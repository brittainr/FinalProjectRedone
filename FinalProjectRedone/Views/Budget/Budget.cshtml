@model FinalProjectRedone.Models.BudgetModel
@{
    ViewData["Title"] = "Budget";
}

the purpose of this application is to allow the user to create budgets and then they can set a limit and see if that limit lines up with their budget, as an added bonus it also factors in their taxes as well. 
This application was so difficult to construct i hope you all can enjoy it as much as i enjoyed creating it.
this page was origionally supposed to be where the budget was created but then i realized that the budget should be created on a seperate page to add more fluidity to the application. this budget page
should have still worked but it doesnt anymore so this page is a scrap page.
